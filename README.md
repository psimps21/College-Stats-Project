The following is a short description on the 4 files of uploaded code
1. RMSEGRAPHS: This code prints the RMSE values for each regression model (Linear, Polynomial and Random Forrest) and shows
a bar graph to visualise the comparison between them. The linear model is the best regression model as it has the lowest RMSE.

2.VNAIRDSMLLIN: This is code for the linear regression model as it first parses through the CSV data file then renames the columns
to make the variable names shorter and easier to work with. Then using the sklearn library, linear regression is modelled using the data
and a graph with the predicted salaries is outputted. RMSE for the linear regression model 

3.VNAIRDSMLPOLY: This file has code for the polynomial regression model and it does similar steps to the linear regression model code.
The polynomial regression model is also done using the sklearn library and plotted to show the predicted versus actual salaries. The RMSE
is also calculated for the polynomial regression

4. VNAIRDSMLRANFOR: This file has code for the random forrest walk regression model and again is very similar to the code for the previous
two models. It again uses the sklearn library and outputs a graph to visualise the prediction as well as the RMSE value for the model.
